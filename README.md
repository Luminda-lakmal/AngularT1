Angular Training 1
==================
Task 1
======
 
I assume you already know how to install and run angular. But just in case, here is how to do it.
1.	Go to NodeJS site and install the latest LTS release of NodeJS
2.	Go to angular site and install the angular cli (https://angular.io/cli)
 
Be sure to run the following commands in the command like and check the installation has gone through correctly
node --version
ng --version
now in windows its: ng version
 
Now you are ready to work with angular
 
This will help you a bit (https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
 
Task 2
======
*** You need to create a new project using angular cli
*** When creating the project, enable routing and select scss as the default styling
*** Create 2 components (home, user)
*** Use the router and set up navigation to each of the component
*** In the final product, you should be able to navigate from one component to the other when you add the correct path in the URL (ex: localhost…/home would take you to one component and locahost…/user would take you to the other component)
 
This will help you out (https://angular.io/start/start-routing)
 
Task 3
======
Update the Task 2 project with the following
*** Add a button to each of the components
*** Use the buttons to navigate from one component to the other
